1. Objective
In this project, you are required to develop a program to implement Distance Vector (DV) Routing Algorithm. Your program should have the following functions:

1) Simulate the process of updating routing tables for a given network topology,
2) Compute minimum cost between 2 specific routers and output the optimal path
